Franks story is harrowing and a massive part of Amsterdams history but I was a bit disappointed with the museum I havent read Anne Franks diaries so the visit to the museum was a whistles top tour but it all felt a bit hectic and disorganised We went while on a mini cruise so booked our tickets as soon as they were available a month or so ahead of sailing and had to queue outside It starts off quite well where only the people in the allotted time slot are allowed in the house but once youre in it seems a bit of a free for all and we didnt even get to see her diaries at the end of the tour as we just couldnt get near them We took about an hour going around but I wouldnt have spent more time there and also be aware of booing if you have any sort of mobility issue as there are large and very steep steps to negotiate and I didnt feel safety was a priority I understand they want to keep it as authentic as it was but it just felt a bit like a hazard around every corner Read more Date of experience February 2020 Helpful Share 020 Rachel wrote a review Jan 2021 Philips burg St Martin St Maarten 27 contributions 9 helpful votes Must see but feels less than a house now Although Anne Franks story is very interesting and it is important that this museum remains it felt indeed more like a museum than a house I visited many years ago in the nineties and back then it felt more like an actual house you visited Now it is a museum and I didnt get that sense of reality as much anymore Still a must visit if youve never been And with the numbers of visited they have to cope with I can understand the need of better logistical ways Read more Date of experience July 2020 Helpful Share Previous 1 USD United States Terms of Use Privacy and Cookies Statement Cookie consent Site Map How
